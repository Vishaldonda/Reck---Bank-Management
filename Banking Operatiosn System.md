# Problem Statement: Banking Operations System
 
A banking institution requires a system to manage basic banking operations, 
- including adding customers,
-  handling deposits and withdrawals,
-  and generating account statements.
 
The system should allow users to perform the following functions efficiently and securely:

```
1. Add Customer
- The system should allow the creation of a new customer account.
- Each customer must have a unique account number, name, contact details, and an initial deposit amount.
- The system should validate customer details before account creation.

2. Deposit Funds
Customers should be able to deposit money into their accounts.
The system should verify the account number before processing the deposit.
The deposited amount should be updated in the customer's account balance.
A transaction record should be created for each deposit.

3. Withdraw Funds
Customers should be able to withdraw money from their accounts.
The system must verify the account number and ensure the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance.
If sufficient funds are available, the withdrawal should be processed, and the balance should be updated accordingly.
A transaction record should be created for each withdrawal.

4. Account Statement
The system should generate an account statement for customers.
The statement should display the transaction history, including deposits, withdrawals, and the current balance.
